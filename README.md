## Features

+ Navigation

    + Featured at the top of the page: the navigation shows the club name in the left hand corner.  This also links to the top of the page and increases in size when hovered over.
    + There is a navigation menu to the right of the top of the page which has three items: Home, About and Contact.  Each links to the relevant point in the web page and underlines when hovered over and remains underlined if the active page.  Home is currently active as this is all featured on one page.
    + The logo is in Font Amatic SC and the navigation Josefin Slab.  I chose these 2 fonts as they work together well on the pages headings and body.  They were sourced from the following article: 
    https://govisually.com/blog/2020s-top-20-google-font-pairs-for-your-next-project/ 
    and selected as they apeared a less formal, contemporary pairing that would appeal to the sites users.  It has no background as the white contrasts nicely with the hero image selected.
    + The Navigation bar tells the user at the outset the focus of the page and enables them to get to the most important information quickly.
